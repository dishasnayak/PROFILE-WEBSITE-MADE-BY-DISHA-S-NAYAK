1. <!DOCTYPE HTML> to tell the computer that this is going to be an HTML page.
2. HTML content is written within the opening <html> tag and closing </html> tag.
<tag/> this is the self closing tag
3. Inside the <html> tags, we can have the <head> tags and <body> tags. 
4. Within the <head> tag we have our title, this is in where we store the information about the page. 
    1. Write the title of our page inside the <head> tags. It is displayed at the top of the browser when you open the web page. To tell the computer that it is a title, we enclose it under the <title> tags.
5. The <body> tags are in which we write content that is displayed on the web page.

    our webpage needs to have a navigation menu that can lead a user to other webpages. These are called hyperlinks. We use <a> tag to create hyperlinks. Let's create two hyperlinks - Projects and About Me.
    <anchor>
     The <a> tag has an attribute called href (hypertext reference) which is used to point the <a> tag to other pages.
    2. Add any kind of content within the <body> tags on the HTML page. For example, to write a paragraph, we use the <p> tags within the <body> tags.
    We use <h1> tags to create a BIG header. Followed by <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6> tags could be used to create SMALLER headers.
